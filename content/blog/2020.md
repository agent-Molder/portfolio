What a year. Aside from the pandemic, Iâ€™ve been working as a Junior Web Dev at my current company for a few months now and am striving to become a Web Dev, minus the junior. I hear itâ€™ll happen soon, so keep an eye out on that update. ðŸ˜‰

It does feel like coming out of bootcamp I should have been capable of typical Dev work, but thereâ€™s a lot of nuances. Sometimes, it feels like Iâ€™m still not being acknowledged as a developer, but most times Iâ€™m just grateful that I get to do this and get paid.

My journey is far from over, and Iâ€™ve got all sorts of strange ambitions. Hope you all are doing well out there. Take care, and make brilliance a const.
