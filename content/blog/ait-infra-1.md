## Infrastructure.
Whew. I had to type that one out slowly. What a strange word. Sound it out.

Okay.

Focus.


Throughout working on this site's theme I've run into a few bugs, my 404 doesn't work, my [nav didn't work](/blog/ait-data-1), my skills section wouldn't budge.

I'll go over the nav and skills sections in other blog posts, but this one is a running catalog of issues I'm running into while learning how to properly set up a Hugo site. This is the blog post where I'll make the most mistakes, as infrastructure is the skill I haven't been able to toy around with as much.

In fact, Infrastructure in tech means something totally different than what I'm getting at here.

So, as per usual, don't forget to make brilliance a **const**.
