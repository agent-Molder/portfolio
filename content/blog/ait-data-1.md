## How far down the rabbit hole do you want to go?
No, that will not be my last Matrix reference. No, I won't apologize for it.

So, data. I love it. Truly, I do, I adore JSON and jump on it at work any chance I can get, and I've learned a lot about YAML just working on this site.

I didn't realize how _fussy_ YAML is, but I don't mind it. I found a [helpful tool here](http://www.yamllint.com/) for those looking to venture into **YAML Ain't Markup Language**. If you're tinkering with Hugo, there's a lot to learn [here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) as well.

While working on actual work-work last night, I had a breakthrough. One that made me go--__HEY, I want to work on MORE data! Where can I find MORE?__ And thus, this site was born. My love of data, however, goes all the way back to my bootcamp days, if not further back into my freelancing period. 

I really started to delve into APIs, JSON, endpoints, and all the shenanigans when I was working in bootcamp, though. (before I forget--there's another great Hugo resource [here in the docs](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/).)

My biggest project was a Superhero site that used an API provided by The Software Guild. The REST API allowed me to parse through the data that I had built, using CRUD techniques with GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST to direct users or data where they needed to be.

I actually have a whole post on the Data Access Objects and Data Transfer Objects used in that project on my slightly older Squarespace site, which I'll link once I have this site all sorted out via Netlify.

But for now, I'll leave you with that teaser, as I plan on making a "Superhero Series" or something of the like on that particular project.

Stay safe out there, and make brilliance a **const**.
