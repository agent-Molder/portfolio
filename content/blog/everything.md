description: "I am confident in my abilities, sure."

A lot of blogging as a dev, I think, is optics. You want to look good, experienced, skilled, talented–you never want to sell yourself short. But we all know and struggle with Impostor Syndrome. Here’s where I’m at these days:

I am confident in my abilities, sure. But there is always room to learn and refresh, and you should never let yourself stagnate as a developer. Technically, I’ve been developing (like many of us) since I was a kid. But realistically I’ve been developing for around eight years, and really seriously developing about three. On paper, a year.

I don’t qualify for most of the work out there, which is the price of working in an industry that puts so much weight for entry level work on the amount of paper certificates you can wrack up. I get it though. I’ve worked with graduates. And practically everyone in my bootcamp had some form of degree. I used to be bitter, and probably sound plenty bitter in this post. But at work I’ve seen brilliant minds made from institutional education and others, still just as brilliant, made from pure elbow grease.

I think the key here is humility. It’s inspiring and reassuring to work with people who can play with that balance of humble and confident.

And persistence.

My first mentor, one of the people I think about almost daily in my work because she’s so damn inspiring, told me I was tenacious. I love that. It’s something that’s come up all over the place in my life; in my writing, at work, in therapy. I am resilient. I get up every time I’m knocked down–and then take the person who knocked me down out for coffee so I can pick their brain a bit.

So. Persistence. Tenacity.

I’m diving into my old bootcamp docs again, two years after graduation (has it seriously been that long?) so that I can continue to move forward. I want to really take time to write here about the concepts we learned there, hopefully with a more honed understanding than when I first traipsed through the trenches of bootcamp.

Keep an eye out for more posts. They’re always in the works over here.

Stay friendly, and of course, make brilliance a const.
